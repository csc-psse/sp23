#### Course Communication

```{card}
ALL course communication is to be done via **EdStem**. Do not e-mail me or any of the TAs and expect a response. General questions should be made publicly so the entire course may benefit from them,and personal questions or partial solutions should be made privately to the staff. If you have a sensitive topic you need to discuss with me away from the TAs, e-mail me and ping me on EdStem to ensure I see it.
```

### Course Objectives

```{card}

- Understand the core aspects of reading/writing code
- Primitive data types
- Variable assignments & operations
- Program control flow
- Control structures & loops
- Simple data structures
- Functions
- Classes & Objects
- Understand the basic principles of programming in C++
- Implement simple algorithms to solve a variety of problems
```

### Action Items

```{card}
Term project incorprates the combination of all subject matter from the course. This is used as the ultimate practical for understanding, comprehension, and overall ability for implementation. The project will be completed in groups of 3-4 members to be presented to the class in Week 14. 
```

```{card}
Labs are a practical application of the material learned each week. Labs are somewhat scaffolded throughout the term in the respect they will grow and incorporate prior weekly materials. Labs are to be completed the lab session and submitted before leaving. Credit will not be granted to submissions outside of this window.
```

```{card}
A practical attempt at code spanning multiple weeks of the course. This is not meant to be difficult but merely to give some practical experience with prior concepts as the term moves forward.
```

```{card}
Each week you will take notes on the lectures. These will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Substantial notes will pass. Substantial notes are complete and can be understood by anyone with a base level of subject releated knowledge. Before submitting notes, ask yourself: "If I handed this to someone who's never seen these topics, could they effectively understand and implement the concepts within?"
```

```{card}
A cumulative exam spanning the duration of the term.
```

### Policies

```{card}
- All assignment solutions are to be uploaded to Brightspace and must be submitted by 11:59PM on the due date.
- All assignments must be demoed to either myself or the TA in order to receive credit
- Missed deliverables cannot be made up.
- Extensions will be handled on an individual basis, but are typically reserved for special cases. Contact me as soon as possible if any extraneous circumstances arise.
```

```{card}
While there are no set meeting times for this class, you are expected to keep up with the weekly uploaded course materials. Do not fall behind!
```

```{card}
If you have a disability, get the required papers from Disability Resources to me by the end of the first full week of class.
```

```{card}
The universityâ€™s academic integrity policy may be viewed here. While discussion amongst peers is encouraged, copying code is unacceptable. If you are caught cheating, you will receive a 0 for that assignment at a minimum.
