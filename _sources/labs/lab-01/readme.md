# Lab 1 : Introduction & Expectations

## Premise

``` {card}
In any programming related course/career, developers need a develoment environment. A place where they can read, write, evaluate/test, debug, and compile code. Some languages require less set up than others, but all programming languages do require some software to get the job done.
```

## Procedure

``` {card}
1. Your task is to do some research on development environments for C++. Evaluate which one you believe you may like to use and justify your reasoning.
2. Attempt to install and compile the simple "Hello World!" program below.
3. Screenshot your development environment with console window visible
   - _Include: code below and compiled output_
```

```` {card} Input

``` {code-block} cpp
#include <iostream>

int main () {
    std::cout << "Hello world!!\n";
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

``` {code-block} bash
Hello world!!
```
