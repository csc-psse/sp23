## Introduction to Programming

## Best Programming Practices

```{card}
[Devising an Algorithm (Part 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q11MdcomARw)  
[Devising an Algorithm (Part 2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bre6jaKgwg0) 

_Note: These videos are excellent in explaining how to devise an algorithm, but make use of the dreaded 'using namespace std;' line. This line of code is highly illegal and will see you thrown in the degenerate programmer's prison! Some readings for why this is terrible practice will be provided elsewhere on the site. Never use this line in this class, or anywhere else!_
```

## Knowledge Check

```{card}
You should be able to answer the following questions:

- What is an algorithm?
- What is pseudocode?
- What is a syntax error?
- What is a C++ program made up of?
- What is the purpose of cout and cin?
- What are some common escape sequences?
- How do variables work in C++?
- What are the different data types in C++ and when should each be used?
```
