## Programming Practices

``````````{card}
```` {card} Problem-Solving Recipe
1. What is it that I'm trying to do?
    - What’s the problem I am trying to solve?
    - What data, if any, will I need to receive?
    - What data, if any, will I need to return?
2. Create a contract:
    - What are your inputs (parameters)?
    - What are your outputs (what you return)?
3. How will I know if it's working?
    - Write test cases for valid input
    - Write test cases for invalid input (error-checking)
4. Solve the problem:
    - What is the list of steps you need to do to solve the problem (algorithm)?
5. Write clean and elegant code that:
    - Follows your contract
    - Does what you want it to do
6. Debug as necessary:
    - Start by checking your algorithm-- does it solve the problem?
    - Check that your code follows your algorithm-- does the code do what you
think it does?

```````` {card} Memory Diagrams - A Tool For Code Tracing
Memory diagrams (as described in an [article by Dragon and Dickson](http://students.cs.uri.edu/~forensics/courses/CSC106/MemoryDiagrams.pdf) are used to help trace code. They are typically hand-written diagrams that reflect the program’s memory over time. Memory diagrams are drawn as “inverted Ts” with two columns: the program’s identifier for the memory (also called `name` ), and the value in the memory (also called `stack` ). Examples are provided below.

**Variables**

As you trace the code from top to bottom, you add memory that the program allocates bottom up to the memory diagram. Consider this example in Javascript where the keyword `var` allocates a new variable and line numbers have been added as comments:

``` {code-block}
var x = 5;
var y = 7;
x = 9;
var total = x + y;
println(total);
```

Output to console
``` {code-block} 
16
```

When tracing this code, you go from top to bottom. 

``````` {tab-set}

`````` {tab-item} 5
The memory diagram for line 1 is:
````` {grid}
```` {grid-item-card}
``` {code-block}
int x = 5;
```
````
```` {grid-item-card}
``` {list-table}
* - x
  - 5
* - identifier
  - value
```
````
`````
Note that you add `x` in the diagram because of the `int` data type denoting a new variable.
``````

`````` {tab-item} 7
Next trace line 2 by adding identifier `y` and its value. Do this above `x` and its value:
````` {grid}
```` {grid-item-card}
``` {code-block}
int x = 5;
int y = 7;
```
````

```` {grid-item-card}
``` {list-table}
* - y
  - 7
* - x
  - 5
* - identifier
  - value
```
````
`````
``````

`````` {tab-item} 9
Next trace line 3. Since there is no new variable, there is no new memory, so you overwrite the value
of `x`. You do this by crossing out the old value of 5 and writing the new value of 9 so that we can
see the history of `x`’s values.
````` {grid}
```` {grid-item-card}
``` {code-block}
int x = 5;
int y = 7;
x = 9;
```
````

```` {grid-item-card}
``` {list-table}
* - y
  - 7
* - x
  - 9
* - identifier
  - value
```
````
`````
``````

`````` {tab-item} total
Tracing line 5 prints to the console, which does not affect memory, so you don’t show it in the memory diagram.

When tracing code, to find the current value of a variable, read down the memory diagram from top to bottom and use the non-crossed out value for the variable.

If the example program had put a var in front of the `x` on line 3, then the program would have allocated another memory cell and called it `x`. This is show in this memory diagram
````` {grid}
```` {grid-item-card}
``` {code-block}
int x = 5;
int y = 7;
x = 9;
int total = x + y;
```
````

```` {grid-item-card}
``` {list-table}
* - total
  - 16
* - x
  - 9
* - y
  - 7
* - x
  - 5
* - identifier
  - value
```
````
`````
This program also returns 16 to the console. Note that `x` appears twice in the memory diagram. Since you read the diagram from top to bottom, the `x` whose value is 9 is used by the program.
The `x` whose value is 5 is wasted memory (sometimes called garbage) - the program will never access it again
