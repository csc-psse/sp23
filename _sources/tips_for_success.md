``` {admonition} Areas of Opportunity
:class: danger
Over-complicating problems: C++ is a powerful language with many features for creating complex programs. Without prior programming knowledge, students may attempt to use complicated features of the language to solve a problem that could be solved with more straightforward code.

Poor debugging skills: Debugging is an important part of programming, and it's often difficult for students to identify and fix errors in their code without prior experience.

Lack of understanding of the language: C++ is a complex language with many features, and without a programming background, students may not have a good understanding of the language's syntax and features.

Not using the right data types: C++ offers a variety of data types, and choosing the wrong type can lead to unexpected results. Additionally, using the wrong data type may lead to inefficient code.

Not following good programming practices: Good programming practices include using comments and following naming conventions, and without prior programming knowledge, students may not be aware of these practices.

```{admonition} Approach
:class: attention
Start by understanding the basics of computer programming. You should familiarize yourself with basic concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, and object-oriented programming.

Read up on the C++ syntax, and look for tutorials online. Make sure to try out the examples given in each tutorial as you go.

Practice, practice, practice! Set aside time each day to work on a few small coding problems, then gradually build up to larger projects.

Take advantage of online resources such as online forums, video tutorials, and Q&A websites.

Make sure to get help when you need it. Don't be afraid to reach out to experienced developers for advice and guidance.
